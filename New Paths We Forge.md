When all around is ash and fire,
When nothing lies before,
Yet now, my friend, my sole desire:
With you, to charge once more.

When flowers wilt, in crimson stained,
When friends each take their leave,
Yet still I find one voice remained:
Your swift and sure relief.

See! How desperate is our home.
Mark! How barren lies our land.
Still, with faith I keep my sacred vow:
Here with you I stand.

When all is done, our promised land
Shall see new petals fly,
New paths we forge with scarr√®d hands
Beneath this chainless sky.
