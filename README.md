Something I want to tell visitor:

1. Many problems seem not related to politics, but the truth is they are related.
2. As `1` said, don't be indifferent to politics and don't feel the people who care about politics are boring.
3. Tech should be used for building a better world, the GFW is not reasonable whatever.
4. The disadvantages GFW brings are much bigger than you thought, the information we get determined our mindset.
5. Waiting for addition...
6. Thinking with information above, you perhaps know where I come from.

If you want to communicate with me, please open an issue in [here](https://github.com/satsukk1/satsukk1/issues)
